Manipulating information at the quantum level is profoundly different from manipulating it classically. This opens the door to some new and surprising applications such as quantum cryptography (in which the security of the encryption of a message is guaranteed by the laws of physics) or quantum computers (which could solve certain problems such as factoring exponentially faster than classical computers). The Laboratoire d’Information quantique is actively working on different aspects quantum information, both at the theoretical and experimental level.
